    <comment id="1" author="Anne" timestamp="2005-01-11 14:26:00.0">I was wondering, is this bug  http://www.jmcardle.com/?postid=77  fixed as well?</comment>
    <comment id="2" author="Bruce Morgan [MSFT]" timestamp="2005-01-11 14:29:00.0">Based on my testing, yes.</comment>
    <comment id="3" author="Chloe" timestamp="2005-01-11 17:48:00.0">A suggestion (OK, probably not one for the IE blog). Why not incorporate the malware removal information, or the Giant anti-spyware tool (if downloaded) into the Security Center?</comment>
    <comment id="4" author="Eric" timestamp="2005-01-12 06:11:00.0">Still not fixed.......http://secunia.com/advisories/12889/</comment>
    <comment id="5" author="Chris" timestamp="2005-01-12 06:41:00.0">Looks like only one of these affects Windows XP SP2. Glad to see all that work you guys put in is paying off.</comment>
    <comment id="6" author="Marc" timestamp="2005-01-12 08:45:00.0">We have seen a huge number of HTML Help exploits in the past year.  Perhaps Microsoft should re-examine the value of building into the OS a tool for executing HTML and scripts in the context of the local user?</comment>
    <comment id="7" author="Joseph Izso" timestamp="2005-01-13 00:28:00.0">So, trust worthy computing? Do you really think, that I can trust MS after releasing MS05-001 patch? I was on secunia.com and tried the vulnerability of my IE and it was vulnerable...From now I can't trust MS: IE is strongly binded with OS and  it's full of holes, like emental.....And waiting for specific date (2nd tuesday of month) to releas highly critical update (MS05-001) doesn't sound like trust worthy computing. The problem was known and MS surely had patch. But it doesn't released it promptly.....I like Windows XP SP2 :-) but I hate IE &amp;amp; OE.</comment>
    <comment id="8" author="John Magnus" timestamp="2005-01-12 13:54:00.0">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830 :.."New versions become available on the second Tuesday of every month. Microsoft may also release an updated version of the tool to supplement these releases if an emergency occurs."</comment>
