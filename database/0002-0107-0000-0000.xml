    <comment id="2" author="Tom" timestamp="2005-08-05 18:04:00.0">Will either, the IE, RSS, or Vista teams be talking about podcasts in relation to the "Simple List Extensions" or support for bittorrent ala  http://www.torrentocracy.com/....</comment>
    <comment id="3" author="Jonathan Hart" timestamp="2005-08-05 18:05:00.0">I am looking forward to the IE7 session.. Congratulations on the latest member of your family! :)</comment>
    <comment id="4" author="Michael" timestamp="2005-08-05 21:41:00.0">Congrats to Dave!....Does anyone know what paper Tony Chor is presenting at the HITB conf in Malaysia? He's listed as a keynote and rumor is that the paper is on IE7 (?) Can anyone from the IE team confirm this????</comment>
    <comment id="5" author="Frank" timestamp="2005-08-06 14:07:00.0">Well,with Google now featuring "Browse by name" in the address bar,when you download their toolbar,could we perhaps see a similar feature in IE7 by default?Also,is there someway to incorporate a translator into Vista to tie in with IE7?Since more and more sites like Google and Yahoo have online translators,but not all languages are covered yet,this would be a big help.Speaking of languages,how about enabling all language packs to be installed by default,with a removal option,so if you need to correctly view ,say, a Chinese web site,you don't have to fool with pack downloads,etc?</comment>
    <comment id="6" author="Nurlich" timestamp="2005-08-06 15:39:00.0">You're already butchering OpenGL with LongWait.....Please leave open standards, like RSS, alone because your crappy anti-competitive attitude means that nobody trusts you.....And no, blogging about IE7 CSS2 support won't help. Look at what you did with your maps, hyped them to the stratosphere and delivered a crappy product, late. Why didn't you ship the improvements instead of saying Real Soon Now?</comment>
    <comment id="7" author="Pete" timestamp="2005-08-06 23:04:00.0">Re: Nurlich....Yeah, while I'm not busy writing code on IE 7, I also code the OpenGL driver and do major work on Virtual Earth. I wish... *This blog is for IE comments. We have no say over what other teams do. Should at least stay on topic with your diss attempts. VE runs a blog, you can hate on them there.....I think the "anti-competitive attitude" is all in your head. No one around the office rants about how to we need to subvert standards and make life harder for you. There are features that we have time to implement and those we don't.</comment>
    <comment id="8" author="Masklinn" timestamp="2005-08-07 04:36:00.0">Will we get some kind of recap of Chris' presentation on this blog?....And could we get some more informations about the upcoming beta2 (especially the improvements over b1) and if there are any changes planned for the Javascript (prototype coding for native classes, ...) and DOM (full  DOM2+ and DOM Events)  supports in IE 7?....And last (but not least), would CS allow you to append "#commentform" to the "Post a Comment" link?</comment>
    <comment id="9" author="wayne" timestamp="2005-08-07 06:35:00.0">re: Nurlich....Who do you think made AJAX and therefor googlemaps possible?....And as for CSS; IE's implementation of the box model has long been criticised for being "non-standards", only now are developers openly admitting that they prefer IE's implementation of the box model. IE7 is a great move in the right direction and most developers (of which which I suspect you are not) are happy with the advances, even the most hardcore anti IE developers seem to admit that this is looking good. In short: your "left wing attitude for dumbies" inspired rant is both uninformed and childish.....w</comment>
    <comment id="10" author="Nick Lowe" timestamp="2005-08-07 13:31:00.0">IE 7 Beta 1 doesnt work properly with links to web folders.....When I click on a link that has the folder=" https://a.webdav.address/"  attribute, I get an action cancelled window and then another window the pops up with the webdav folder.....Any chance of checking this out sometime?....Cheers,....Nick</comment>
    <comment id="11" author="Nick Lowe" timestamp="2005-08-07 13:41:00.0">With XP SP2, you introduced some great improvements to MIME handling in the browser.....One of these is MIME type detection which determines the MIME type of downloaded content.....It would be fantastic if Administrators had more control over this in Group Policy.....At the moment, for example, we cannot define unacceptable mime types in each of the zones to stop them being downloaded.....(For example, disallowing detected executables in the Internet Zone is not possible.)....Any chance of doing something about this?</comment>
    <comment id="12" author="Nick Lowe" timestamp="2005-08-07 14:17:00.0">Go here:....http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/bf/pix/d865gbf_lg.jpg....Hold cursor over image so that the picture resize button appears.....Click on the resize button.....Roll the mouse wheel to scroll down watching the picture resize button.</comment>
    <comment id="13" author="Nick Lowe" timestamp="2005-08-07 14:48:00.0">When a file is downloaded it is copied from the cache and not moved on download.....This is especially noticable with large files where the cache is on the same drive as the destination drive.....P.S. I did not get into the beta so cannot submit bigs through that channel.</comment>
    <comment id="14" author="Pete" timestamp="2005-08-07 15:19:00.0">Re: Nick Lowe....I consider that behavior to be by design. It isn't quite a bug. There are good reasons for the file to be cached.....I think you want to make a feature request to be able to bypass the caching behavior when saving a [large] file to disk.</comment>
    <comment id="15" author="Nick Lowe" timestamp="2005-08-07 16:33:00.0">[QUOTE]I consider that behavior to be by design. It isn't quite a bug. There are good reasons for the file to be cached.[/QUOTE]....Obviously browser rendered content needs to be cached - but files being explicitly downloaded?....Surely it only needs to be in the cache while being downloaded? From there it can be resumed should the stream fail for some reason. Once finished - just move the file out? Am I missing something here???....And seperately: Work also needs to be done to thread the FTP client so that it does not appear hung when waiting for the server to respond or something is timing out.</comment>
    <comment id="16" author="Pete" timestamp="2005-08-07 19:12:00.0">Re: Nick Lowe....The caching is more of a respect to web standards/web servers than anything. It is like the two connection limitation, the user might get degraded performance but it was decided on long ago to play nice for server load issues.....Yeah the ftp stuff is a bit rotten. It has some blocking calls that are uninteruptable. Never looked at the code, but from other net code I've written, I'm betting it just does a TCP connect() on the same thread as the UI.</comment>
    <comment id="17" author="Nathan Smith" timestamp="2005-08-08 09:35:00.0">I'm not sure where to post this exactly, but I think I've found a previously undocumented IE6 CSS bug. I've written about it here.......http://sonspring.com/index.php?id=102....Demonstration here.......http://host.sonspring.com/multi-class/</comment>
    <comment id="18" author="Masklinn" timestamp="2005-08-08 09:50:00.0">Nathan Smith &amp;gt; While i have no idea of the documentation state of this bug, I find quite hard to believe that it's never been documented. I've known it for some time and have already seen blog posts about the (lack of) IE's handling of multiple selectors for a single element</comment>
    <comment id="19" author="Jean Pascal" timestamp="2005-08-08 09:53:00.0">Dear IE developers,....I already tried the beta-version of IE 7 and wondered why I couldn't find support for International Domain Names.....I guess it's finally time to be international. Think of all the French, Chinese and German people waiting for the support for almost 3 years now.....The European Tech-News all announced Microsoft was integrating this significant feature in IE 7.....Sincerely, Jean Pascal</comment>
    <comment id="20" author="Ray" timestamp="2005-08-09 02:04:00.0">Feel free to tell me where I should send/post this but I just gotta say this somewhere before this beta goes public. Here are my MAJOR gripes:....1) Can't move/reposition the address bar ?..2) Cant close the search ?..3) Every other program in the world has File/Edit toolbar on top ... why would they change it now?..4) No Stop or Refresh ? At all ? Can't even choose to add it ? I just don't think I can browse without either...5) Would like to be able to open several tabs on open ( if it can do this I haven't found it yet )....This is a beta and I'm usually pretty forgiving but some of these are so glaring I'm a wee bit concerned.....Sorry if this was the wrong place but this beta is scary.....- Ray..</comment>
    <comment id="21" author="Sebhelyesfarku" timestamp="2005-08-09 04:17:00.0">LOL how true! And a couple of millions of poor Windoze users learned as well!</comment>
    <comment id="22" author="Xepol" timestamp="2005-08-09 16:34:00.0">You've definitely made the right choice.  There is always another PDC, but the birth of your child is an experience you'll never remember clearly.....Or at all if you are foolish enough to try to video tape it (head injuries are treated in a different wing of the hospital after all!)....Looking forward to beta 2 with real UI improvements (Someone fix the freaking links toolbar buttons being all the same size, or better yet, enhance it as suggested by me in previous posts to let it launch whole sets of tabs at once).</comment>
    <comment id="23" author="junkie" timestamp="2005-08-09 19:34:00.0">I like IE7 but this thing has just been crashing 3 times in a row around the AP.org RSS feed section...</comment>
    <comment id="24" author="Viktor" timestamp="2005-08-10 08:16:00.0">As others have already mentioned, one big advantage of Internet Explorer over other browsers was the customizability of the toolbar controls. Please make it possible that the user can change the position/order of the menu, address and tab-bar at will.....It should also be possible to hide the address bar like any other toolbar. There are usage scenarios that rely on this:....* saving real estate (i.e. in pop up windows)..* restricting usage (user is not allowed to enter URLs)..* when no keyboard is available (user has only a mouse or touch screen)..* using a 3rd-party toolbar for navigating (like the Google or Quero Toolbar)....Thanks</comment>

No one around the office rants about how to we need to subvert standards and make life harder for you. There are features that we have time to implement and those we don't."..Your choices about features to implement or not are quite difficult to understand (web standard for example).......Is there an extention system in IE7 as the firefox one ? For the web developper, there's a lot of very usefull extentions (HTML validation, css edition, advanced javascript console).....</comment>
    <comment id="26" author="Kevin Anderson" timestamp="2005-08-22 09:56:00.0">I thought I would post a comment to ask question - is CDF support now offically dropped as it no longer works in IE7 Beta 1. I know RSS is being pushed hard at the moment. However, I know many people still use the CDF format to provide enhanced favourites. Would CDF support not be worth keeping for backward compatibility reasons?........</comment>
