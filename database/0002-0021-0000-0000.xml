    <sentence-list count="13">
      <sentence position="1" labelers="3">Hi, I m Christopher Vaughan, and I m the lead project manager for the Internet Explorer team.</sentence>
      <sentence position="2" labelers="1">I ve worked on IE on and off since the IE 3.0 days, and have been involved in every major Windows release since Windows 95.</sentence>
      <sentence position="3" labelers="1">I work with Dean, Scott, Tony, Dave, and the others who have or will be posting here to make sure that the IE team is working on the right things and at the right times.</sentence>
      <sentence position="4" labelers="1, 2, 4">I wanted to drop a quick note to make sure people knew about an update to our user agent string in Windows XP Service Pack 2.</sentence>
      <sentence position="5" labelers="1, 2, 3, 4">We ve added "SV1" to the UA string so it ll start looking something like this: HTTP_USER_AGENT :Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1 ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 1.0.3705) This will let site authors know that they re being visited by someone who s running an IE browser on the latest, most secure Microsoft platform.</sentence>

    <comment id="1" author="J. King" timestamp="2004-09-02 14:06:00.0">Forgive me, but isn't it much simpler to just bump up the version number?  IE's UA string is too long to begin with and already quite filled with less-than-obvious information.....Why the insistance on staying at version 6.0 when IE has obviously had several major enhancements?</comment>
    <comment id="2" author="Barry Dorrans" timestamp="2004-09-02 15:26:00.0">There is a downside. Now the spyware manufacturers can customise their installers and you end up with screen shots like the one I blogged about at  http://idunno.org/displayBlog.aspx/2004082901</comment>
    <comment id="3" author="Rory Parle" timestamp="2004-09-02 16:36:00.0">Why does IE claim to be Mozilla? Or even Mozilla compatible? There are several major browsers more like Mozilla than IE is.</comment>
    <comment id="4" author="Sears Young" timestamp="2004-09-02 18:55:00.0">FYI, when you install SP2 on a Windows XP Tablet PC Edition machine the UA string will be updated to include "Tablet PC 1.7", in addition to "SV1".</comment>
    <comment id="5" author="snowknight" timestamp="2004-09-02 19:03:00.0">Rory..Its a legacy of the browser wars.  When IE still had little market share, it, like many other browsers, started copying Netscape's UA which has always started with "Mozilla".  This was to prevent it from being locked out of sites.  When IE became a major web browser, other browsers began to mimic it.</comment>
    <comment id="6" author="Simon F. P. Murray" timestamp="2004-09-03 01:23:00.0">Regarding the 'Mozilla' prefix on the string- given that things have now inverted, and we find browsers like Opera putting 'IE' etc. in their default using string... do you suspect 'Mozilla' on IE's user agent string will ever be dropped- perhaps as a sign that IE stands on its own feet now, if nothing else?</comment>
    <comment id="7" author="Milan Negovan" timestamp="2004-09-03 07:18:00.0">The only good reason (that I can think of) to sniff for "SV1" is to accomodate the unwanted status bar in dialog windows. See  http://www.aspnetresources.com/blog/sp2_early_tweak.aspx .</comment>
    <comment id="8" author="ad   Weblog" timestamp="2004-09-03 17:28:00.0">With Windows XP Service Pack 2 the web browser user agent string changes for internet explorer to SV1 aka "Security Version 1". Like that&amp;#180;s logical! Hence, what did we have before SP2 - only security version 0 ? [small rant]</comment>
    <comment id="9" author="J. King" timestamp="2004-09-03 22:23:00.0">I'm not so much worried about the past as much as the future.  How does this new identifier age?  Under what kind of circumstances will we see SV2?  Would a hypothetical MSIE 7.0 still be SV1?  Will it not have any SV identifier?  Has the SV identifier become the new version number with the "MSIE #.#" substring forever frozen?....Logically, all future versions of IE will have at least the same security measures and likely supperior ones as new vulnerabilities are found and addressed.  "SV1" would quickly become meaningless.</comment>
    <comment id="10" author="Adam Hauner" timestamp="2004-09-04 14:53:00.0">Why is such problem to increase minor version of browser? Everybody in browser business is doing such thing, so Microsoft has to do something different? Will MSIE 7 be in UA string "MSIE 6.0; ... SV1a"?</comment>
    <comment id="11" author="Eric" timestamp="2004-09-05 08:30:00.0">Security Version 1! Haha! I'm glad after six versions, you've finally decided to add security. :D</comment>
    <comment id="12" author="Greg K Nicholson" timestamp="2004-09-05 08:31:00.0">What's gonna happen if the Mozilla Foundation start insisting that IE can't claim to be "Mozilla" because it dilutes their brand?</comment>
    <comment id="13" author="mangoduck" timestamp="2004-09-05 08:38:00.0">I reiterate all above comments. And who's idea was it to add sv1 instead of incrementing the version? I have a nice meringue pie for that gentleman/lady. Just how many separate version numbers do we need?....Where's the bit about "Bacon 2.4.x", eh? It is so useful that I can't live without it!</comment>
    <comment id="14" author="Jonathan" timestamp="2004-09-05 11:50:00.0">Unfortunately, this also allows web sites that used to use pop-up ads to know that the popups would be blocked, and to serve annoying flash ads instead....</comment>

    <comment id="16" author="realitybath" timestamp="2004-09-05 16:44:00.0">thanks! updating firefox user agent switcher ie uas</comment>
    <comment id="17" author="Bruce" timestamp="2004-09-05 17:18:00.0">Popup blockers are usually detectable because the popup window fails to create.  That detection method works cross platform and cross browser, so why bother with user agent string stuff?</comment>
    <comment id="18" author="a fish" timestamp="2004-09-06 12:04:00.0">IE is only Mozilla *4.0* compatible.  *snicker*  Anyway, if the Mozilla people were gonna whine about Microsoft using its name in their user agent string, that would've (and maybe did?) come up during Netscape/AOL's court case against them, if not earlier....."soon you&amp;#8217;ll see this token show up on other platforms as we bring our security enhancements to them."....aha!  So there *will* be updates to IE for other platforms!  Good to know.</comment>
    <comment id="19" author="Soren Werk" timestamp="2004-09-06 07:39:00.0">We need to sniff for SV1 for the following workaround:....Problem:..When a PDF document *residing in a frame* in IE60 under XPSP2 calls an ASP file with [PDF function] submitForm() nothing displays in the browser window. This seems to be a new bug introduced in XPSP2. Anyone have an explanation?....Workaround:..We normally want the PDF document in the frame but are willing to (have to!) place it outside all frames when we detect XPSP2 - by sniffing SV1...</comment>
    <comment id="20" author="Turnip" timestamp="2004-09-07 00:00:00.0">http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20040811  - lol</comment>
    <comment id="21" author="J. King" timestamp="2004-09-06 19:38:00.0">Soren Werk:..And what happens when IE is updated to SV2?  It would have to a regular expression to be reliable---which would make the whole "SV1" thing moot as the version number could simply be incremented.  I -really- don't see the advantage.  Indeed, I see only disadvantages in the long run.</comment>

    <comment id="23" author="Soren Werk" timestamp="2004-09-08 05:56:00.0">I agree - "SV1" is a hackish word.....But has anyone else observed the problem we have? (described above)</comment>

Although the workaround is really a problem for us as it confuses users when Adobe Form is launched on a separate window.....We will ask Adobe developer support for a solution, we will appreciate if someone can shared with us for any solution to executing PDF forms within Frame/Frameset under XP SP2.....</comment>
    <comment id="25" author="Web Designer" timestamp="2004-09-09 15:58:00.0">The "information bar" is a complete nightmare and disaster for anyone who uses css, layers, gallery type functions, etc. in their designs. Will IE be offering any tools to designers so that every site they've designed this way isn't completely worthless??? Seriously, this is completely unacceptable!</comment>

    <comment id="27" author="b0" timestamp="2004-09-24 00:43:00.0">Well this is really wonderful.  Now a site that wants to run an exploit against a user will know what patches are on the machine so it will know exactly what exploit to run against the client computer.  The site running the exploits will not have to guess.  Maybe this is an improvement for the crackers.  Is this called "BETTER" security????</comment>
